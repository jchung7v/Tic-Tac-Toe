# tic-tac-toe

Hi, this is my solution to the tic-tac-toe Tutorial on React.

https://react.dev/learn/tutorial-tic-tac-toe

### The challenges

I should:

- Build it according to basic rules of tic-tac-toe
- The first player uses X symbole, while the second player uses the O symbol
- Players take turns placing their symbols in an empty cell(Square)
- The game continues until a player has three of symbols in a row(horizontally, vertically, or diagnoally)

### What I learned

Working on this tutorial, I was able to improve my React skills. I learned...

- how to setup React environment for the tutorial
- what components, props, and states are and how to use them
- how to analyze a figma-generated design file and apply every component to CSS style

### Continued development

If I have spare time, I would like to do following works.

- I'd like to add a time travel, which enable users to go back to the previous moves in the game
